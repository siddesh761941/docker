Docker is a container technology
   - A tool for creating and managing containers

Container - A standardized unit of software
     - A package of code and dependencies to run that code
     - The same container always yields the exact same application and
       execution behaviour

Why containers
   - Different Development environments
   - Different development environemnts within a team/company
   - Clashing tools/versions between different projects

vm's vs Docker
   - Redundant duplication, waste of space
   - performance can be slow, boot times can be long
   
Images and containers
   - Images are templates/Blueprints for containers 
   - Contains code + required tools/runtimes 
   
   - Containers are running instances of images

   - Images are read-only

Image Layer
   - Every instruction is a layer
   - These layers are cached
   - If one layer changes all below layers are rebuild
